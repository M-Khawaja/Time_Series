# Sales Performance Analysis & Forecasting (Time Series)

This project analyses historical sales data to identify seasonal patterns and forecast future revenue. Using SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LightGBM models, we compare performance across different forecasting strategies. The Prophet model achieved the best overall accuracy (lowest MAE & MAPE), making it our recommended choice for future sales prediction.
